ChipWhisperer is an open source toolchain that makes learning about
side-channel attacks easy and affordable.  It also serves as a platform for
performing side-channel research in a well documented, cost-effective, and
repeatable way.  ChipWhisperer is mostly focused on power analysis attacks
and voltage and clock glitching, which disrupt a device's power supply or
clock signal to cause unintended behaviour (such as skipping a password
check).

ChipWhisperer-lite
------------------
This entry-level board is preloaded with an application that queries the user
with some ciphertext and then runs AES-128-CBC decryption.  It is a perfect
target for students to practice side-channel timing attacks.
More precisely, the preloaded application takes as input a hex-encoded 
sequence of bytes.  Its size must be a multiple of 16 (the size of the AES 
block).  The first block is a 16-byte IV.  There must be at least two blocks
(IV + >= 1 ciphertext block).

ChipWhisperer-Pro
-----------------
This advanced board is preloaded with an application that queries the user
with some ciphertext and then runs textbook RSA decryption.  The probe on the
board is preloaded with a procedure that observes the most significant bit
of the plaintext and leaks it.  In other terms, if the RSA modulus is k-bit
long (2**(k-1) <= N < 2^k), then the boolean that leaks is
    (input**d) % N >= 2**(k-1).
